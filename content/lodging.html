    <p>
      Both of our hotel selections are equidistant from the
      Commandant’s House.  These two options are both walkable to the
      venue and have reasonable prices (for Boston, at least).  There
      are many more luxurious options in the Boston/Cambridge area that
      are just a short taxi ride away.  For those who choose to stay in
      downtown Boston, there's also a <a
          href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/boats/lines/?route=F4&timing=S&RedisplayTime=Redisplay+Time">water
          taxi</a> that leaves from Long Wharf (next to the Boston
      Aquarium) regularly from 6:30am — 8:00pm.  The boat docks within
      the Navy Yard, leaving you a short walk to the hotels and the
      Commandant’s House.

        Boston's historic, cultural, and entertainment attractions.
        We were able to reserve a block of rooms at a rate of $129 per
        night (normally $189).  Validated parking is available at the
        parking garage for the nearby Mass. General Hospital East.
