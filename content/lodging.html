    <p>
      Both of our hotel selections are equidistant from the
      Commandant’s House.  These two options are both walkable to the
      venue and have reasonable prices (for Boston, at least).  There
      are many more luxurious options in the Boston/Cambridge area
      that are just a short cab or water taxi ride away.  For those
      who choose to stay in downtown Boston, there's
      a <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/boats/lines/?route=F4&timing=S&RedisplayTime=Redisplay+Time">commuter
      boat</a> that leaves from Long Wharf (next to the Boston
      Aquarium) regularly from 6:30am — 8:00pm.  The boat docks within
      the Navy Yard, leaving you a short walk to the hotels and the
      Commandant’s House.
