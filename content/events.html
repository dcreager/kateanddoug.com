<h2>Pre-wedding festivities</h2>

<p>
  We'll try to plan some interesting activities for the days leading up
  to the wedding.  Also, the wedding takes place the weekend after the
  Fourth of July; if you haven't seen the fireworks over the Charles
  River, you should!
</p>

<h2>That whole wedding thing</h2>

<p>
  We will be having an outdoor ceremony on the East Lawn of the
  <a href="http://www.commandantshouse.com/index.html">Commandant’s
      House</a> in Charlestown, Massachusetts.  After the ceremony, we
  will be hosting a cocktail hour inside the Commandant’s House, where
  you will be able to enjoy some of the detailed architecture of this
  great historical site.  We will be having our tented reception on the
  West Lawn of the Commandant’s House, where you will be able to enjoy
  views of the USS Constitution, the Boston Harbor and the Boston
  skyline.  The tentative schedule for the day is:
