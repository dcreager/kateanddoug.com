    <h2>Airport</h2>

    <p>
      If you're flying in for the wedding, Boston is served by Logan
      International Airport (BOS).  Southwest, AirTran, and JetBlue are
      all low-cost airlines that fly into Logan.  The easiest way to get
      to the hotel from the airport is by taxi, which will run about $30
      each way.  You can also fly into Providence, R.I., or Manchester,
      N.H., although those are a good hour away by car.
    </p>

    <h2>Wedding venue</h2>

    <p>
      If you're local, and driving to the Commandant's House on the day
      of the wedding, you can find directions <a
        href="http://commandantshouse.com/commandants_house_directions.html">here</a>.
      Follow the directions to the “Nautica Garage”; you won’t be able
      to drive into the Navy Yard itself, but the Nautica Garage is
      walking distance to the Commandant's House.
