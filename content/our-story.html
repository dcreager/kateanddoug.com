      <h2>Meeting each other</h2>

      <p>
        Doug and Kate met at a wedding in August 2007.  Doug served as a
        groomsman for the groom, Kevin Schmidt, one of his friends and
        frat buddies from MIT.  Kate knew the bride, Laura Lent, from
        growing up together in Clinton.

        Kate had just graduated from law school and taken the bar a few
        weeks prior, while Doug had just submitted his thesis for his
        PhD program.  Needless to say, they both were at a great point
        in their lives to meet that special someone.

      <h2>The proposal</h2>

      <p>
        By early 2010, Doug and Kate both knew they were ready to take
        the next step.  They had a trip to New York planned for that
        April, to attend a reunion dinner for the North American alumni
        of Doug's college at Oxford.  Kate suspected that that would be
        when he would pop the question.  (Not at the reunion dinner —
        during the trip!)

        Doug had other plans in mind, however.  A few weeks earlier,
        Doug and Kate were lucky enough to attend the first round of
        playoff games for the NCAA basketball tournmanent in Providence,
        Rhode Island.  Having visited there together several times
        before and since, Providence had a more sentimental feel.  After
        a long day of basketball games at the Dunkin Donuts Center (a
        truly New England arena name if ever there was one), Doug asked
        Kate to spend the rest of her life with him.  As you may have
        guessed, she said “yes!”
