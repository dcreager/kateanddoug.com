      <h2>Doug</h2>

      <p>
        As Doug will tell you (in far too much detail), he was born in
        Florida, then moved to Minnesota for 11 years, then to North
        Carolina, and then arrived in Boston for college.  In 2004,
        Doug crossed the pond to study in Oxford for 3 years to get
        his PhD.  After Oxford, Doug came back to Boston, the city he
        loves, and has remained there since.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doug currently works for a startup based in Washington, DC —
        though for the most part, he's able to work out of his home
        office, using one of his many computers.  In his spare time,
        Doug likes to cheer on the Red Sox (in person and on TV),
        cook, read, and most of all, hang out with Kate.

      <h2>Kate</h2>

      <p>
        Kate was born and raised in Clinton, Massachusetts, which is
        in Central (<i>not</i> Western!) Mass.  Having grown up in
        Central Mass., Kate worked at a variety of apple orchards
        during high school and could tell you the best pie-baking
        apples (Cortlands), how to make cider donuts, and even where
        Johnny Appleseed was born.  After spending time in both
        Providence and upstate New York for college, Kate moved to
        Boston for law school and has stayed there ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kate currently works in Wellesley, doing some form of
        lawyering.  In her free time, Kate likes to cook, bake apple
        pies, hang out with her friends and family, and most of all,
        hang out with Doug.
