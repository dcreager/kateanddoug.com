<h1>About us</h1>

<h2>Doug</h2>

<p>
  As Doug will tell you (in far too much detail), he was born in
  Florida, then moved to Minnesota for 11 years, then to North
  Carolina, and arrived in Boston college.  Doug crossed to pond for 3
  years while studying for his PhD in England, and then finally came
  back to Boston, the city he loves.

<p>
  Doug currently works out of his home office on one of his six
  computers.  In his fun time, Doug likes to cheer on the Red Sox (in
  person and on TV), cook, read, and most of all, hang out with Kate.

<h2>Kate</h2>

<p>
  Kate was born and raised in Clinton, Massachusetts, which in in
  Central (<i>not</i> Western!) Mass.  After a short stint in New
  York, Kate moved to Boston for law school and has stayed there every
  since.  Kate currently works in Wellesley, doing some form of
  lawyering.  In her free time, Kate likes to cook, bake apple pies,
  hang out with her friends and family, and most of all, hang out with
  Doug.
