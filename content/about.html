      <h2>Doug</h2>

      <p>
        As Doug will tell you (in far too much detail), he was born in
        Florida, then moved to Minnesota for 11 years, then to North
        Carolina, and arrived in Boston for college.  Doug crossed the
        pond for 3 years while studying for his PhD in England, and
        then finally came back to Boston, the city he loves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doug currently works out of his home office, using one of his
        six computers.  In his spare time, Doug likes to cheer on the
        Red Sox (in person and on TV), cook, read, and most of all,
        hang out with Kate.

      <h2>Kate</h2>

      <p>
        Kate was born and raised in Clinton, Massachusetts, which is
        in Central (<i>not</i> Western!) Mass.  After a short stint in
        upstate New York, Kate moved to Boston for law school and has
        stayed there ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kate currently works in Wellesley, doing some form of
        lawyering.  In her free time, Kate likes to cook, bake apple
        pies, hang out with her friends and family, and most of all,
        hang out with Doug.
