      <h2>Doug</h2>

      <p>
        As Doug will tell you (in far too much detail), he was born in
        Florida, then moved to Minnesota for 11 years, then to North
        Carolina, and arrived in Boston college.  Doug crossed to pond
        for 3 years while studying for his PhD in England, and then
        finally came back to Boston, the city he loves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doug currently works out of his home office on one of his six
        computers.  In his fun time, Doug likes to cheer on the Red
        Sox (in person and on TV), cook, read, and most of all, hang
        out with Kate.

      <h2>Kate</h2>

      <p>
        Kate was born and raised in Clinton, Massachusetts, which in
        in Central (<i>not</i> Western!) Mass.  After a short stint in
        New York, Kate moved to Boston for law school and has stayed
        there every since.  Kate currently works in Wellesley, doing
        some form of lawyering.  In her free time, Kate likes to cook,
        bake apple pies, hang out with her friends and family, and
        most of all, hang out with Doug.
